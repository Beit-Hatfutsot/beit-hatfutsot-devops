# beit-hatfutsot-devops
Devops code and documentation for Beit Hatfutsot - The Museum of The Jewish People

## Project goals and aspirations

Beit Hatfutsot have many projects both online ([the databases website](http://dbs.bh.org.il/)) and offline ([instagram feed projected in the museum lobby](https://github.com/Beit-Hatfutsot/dbs-back/issues/109))

Some projects interact with multiple github repositores (the databases website [frontend](https://github.com/Beit-Hatfutsot/dbs-front) and [backend](https://github.com/Beit-Hatfutsot/dbs-back))

We also have infrastructure, servers and databases to support those projects

The goal of this repo is to centralize all those components in a single repository.

This repository will contain documentation about how the components interact and also code to support the different components.
